# Automated Image Classification using MLOps üöÄüñºÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Automated Image Classification using MLOps** project! This repository demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps pipeline designed for chest X-ray classification, helping in the early detection of pulmonary conditions using state-of-the-art deep learning and cloud infrastructure.

---

## Overview üåü

In this project, we have engineered a robust MLOps pipeline on **AWS** that leverages:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification.
- **Pre-trained models** (VGG16, ResNet) with transfer learning using **TensorFlow**.
- **Data Version Control (DVC)** for managing datasets effectively.
- **MLflow** for experiment tracking and reproducibility.
- A **CI/CD pipeline** deployed on **AWS EC2** to streamline deployments and updates.

This automated system significantly enhances clinical decision-making by enabling rapid and accurate analysis of chest X-rays for early detection of pulmonary conditions.
